        <p><b>The people of Ladakh are known for their resilience, warmth, and deep-rooted cultural traditions shaped by
                the region’s harsh climate and Buddhist heritage.</b> Here's a glimpse into their lives, along with some
            images
            to bring their world to life.</p>
    </h4>
    <p>Ladakhis are primarily of Tibetan and Indo-Aryan descent, and their way of life reflects a harmonious blend of
        these influences. Most people follow Tibetan Buddhism, which is evident in their monasteries, festivals, and
        daily rituals. The traditional attire—such as the goncha (a thick robe) and vibrant headgear—helps them endure
        the cold and symbolizes their cultural identity. Their homes, often built from mud bricks and wood, are designed
        to retain warmth during the long, frigid winters.</p>
    <p>Community life in Ladakh is deeply cooperative. Agriculture, especially barley and wheat farming, is central to
        their livelihood, along with animal husbandry. Festivals like Losar (Tibetan New Year) and Hemis are celebrated
        with masked dances, music, and feasting. Despite modernization, Ladakhis maintain a strong connection to their
        traditions, spirituality, and environment, making their culture both unique and enduring.</p>
